# Steps to Run
- Open the project in IntelliJ
- Run MainApp.java
- If the JavaFX screen looks bigger than the laptop screen, adjust your laptop's display scale in Display Settings

# Gameplay
- Long press space bar to extend stick
- Press space bar during stick traversal to flip upside down
- Collect coins
- Coins can be exchanged for revival after crash
- If the player collides with a platform while upside down it counts as a crash
- Perfect landing gets you one bonus point

# Design Practices
- Singleton: Player
- Modified Singleton: Cherry
- Strategy: traversestick() method in Player decides at runtime whether game will continue or player dies
